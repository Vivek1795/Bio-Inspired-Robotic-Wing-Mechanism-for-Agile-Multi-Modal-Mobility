# Bio-Inspired-Robotic-Wing-Mechanism-for-Agile-Multi-Modal-Mobility
Bio-inspired robot mimicking bat flight using a 4-bar flapping mechanism and adaptive wings. Combines PLA structure, vinyl-laminated wings, MuJoCo simulation, and real-world validation to optimize gliding and flapping dynamics for agile, multi-modal locomotion.
